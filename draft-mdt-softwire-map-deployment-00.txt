Internet-Draft                     MAP                     November 2011


1.  Overview

   IPv4 address exhaustion has becoming world-wide reality and the main
   stream of deployment since now on is IPv6-only networking.
   Meanwhile, having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a
   long-term requirement, lasting until the completion of the IPv6
   transition.  It demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4
   communications across the IPv6-only domain(s).

   Mapping of Address and Port (MAP)
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] is designed in response
   to the requirement of stateless residual deployment.  The term
   "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
   recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
   domain backbone.  MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the
   prerequisite of deployment so that native IPv6 services and
   applications are fully supported and encouraged.  The statelessness
   of MAP ensures only moderate overhead is added to part of the network
   devices.

   Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators.  This document
   is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP,
   i.e., when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own
   operational requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility
   conditions, in the phase of IPv4 residual deployment.  Potential
   readers of this document are those who want to know:

   1.  What kind of deployment requirements does MAP satisfy?

   2.  What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
       and how?

   3.  How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
       IPv4 pools?

   4.  How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
       administrations?

   5.  How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?

4.  Deployment considerations

4.1.  Flexible Assigment of Port Sets

   Different classes of customers require port sets of different size.
   In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would be
   satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to be
   assigned a single IPv4 address or delegated an IPv4 subnet.

4.2.  Traffic Classification

   Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service quality
   for different classes of customers.  This feature is also helpful for
   customer behavior monitoring and security protection.  For example,
   DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by operators for
   corporations to cater for their Internet communications needs.
   Service is made by means of the edge router features and key systems,
   like ACL (Access List Control) to classify different traffic.  Five
   tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
   Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4.  Vendors are delivering
   or committed to support that feature for IPv6.  In order to
   facilitating IPv6 deployment, MAP solution should support this
   feature on IPv6 plane.

4.3.  Prefix Delegation Deployment

   Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
   mobile network.  In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced
   in 3GPP network in Release 10.  The deployment of PD would be
   supported in 4v6 case.  Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to
   CPE for deriving IPv4 information.

4.4.  Coexisting Deployment

   4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
   coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
   cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.  (Note: more coexisting
   cases are expected to be investigated in future.)

   o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6 translation

   o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
   Translation)

   o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC

4.5.  Friendly to Network Provisioning

   Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
   different users and the compatible with the address assignment
   techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
   management plane.  In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
   is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users.  And
   management plane for one family address is better than two, namely
   the operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6.
   Since only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is
   naturally conducted only via IPv6.

4.6.  Enable privacy addresses

   User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
   deployed.  Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
   interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941].
   Ability to change the interface identifier over time makes it more
   difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to
   identify when different addresses used in different sessions actually
   correspond to the same node.

4.7.  Facilitating 4v6 Service

   Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
   address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server.  The service provisioning
   may require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023).
   MAP would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port
   range including the 0-1023.  Afterwards, operators could decide to
   assign it to any requesting user.

4.8.  Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning

   The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
   encoded IPv4 or port ID information.  MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
   imported in IPv6.

4.9.  Optimized Routing Path

   MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
   case.  Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
   in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
   but others geographically closed to traffic initiators.  In mesh
   cases, traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going
   through remote border point.

5.  Operational Guidance

   This section is purposed to provide a referential guideline to
   operators, illustrating a common usage of MAP in IPv4 residual
   deployment.

   Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning.  A simple
   example is taken inline for easy understanding.

   (A) IPv6 considerations

   (A1)  Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be supported, and, for
         generality, suppose N = 2^n.

         For example, we suppose n = 20.  It means there will be up to
         about one million CEs.

   (A2)  Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to ordinary
         customers.

         Considering we have a /32 IPv6 block, it is not a problem for
         the IPv6 deployment with the given number of CEs.  Let x = 60,
         allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated networks.

   (A3)  Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of two (K = 2 ^
         k), to take into account that:

      -  Some privileged customers may be assigned IPv6 prefixes of
         length x', shorter than x, to have larger addressing spaces
         than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and IPv4;

      -  Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many theoretically
         delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable (ref: host
         density ratio of [RFC3194]).

         In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.

   (B) IPv4 considerations

   (B1)  List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to any in-running
         networks) IPv4 prefixes Hi that are available for IPv4 residual
         deployment.

         Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet assigned to any
         fixed network: 192.32../16 and 63.245../16.






N                         Expires June 2, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                     MAP                     November 2011


   (B2)  Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to get a total
         whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes a good
         proportion of the available IPv4 space.

         If the M < N, addresses should be shared by N CEs and thus each
         is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m) CEs with PSID length of (n - m).

         If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore m = 17.
         Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the corresponding sharing
         ratio is also determined so that each CE can have 8192 ports to
         use under the shared global IPv4 address.

   (B3)  For each IPv4 prefix Hi of length hi, choose a "rule index",
         i.e., the 4pfx in Fig.C-1 and Fig.C-3, say Ri of length ri = m
         - (32 - hi).

         All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes (e.g. 0, 10,
         110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12).

         Then we have:

             H1 = 192.32../16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0);
             H2 = 63.245../16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1);

   (C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s)

   (C1)  Derive the length c of the "Common prefix" C that will appear
         at the beginning of all delegated prefixes (c = x - (n + k)).

   (C2)  Take any prefix for this C of length c that starts with a RIR-
         allocated IPv6 prefix.

   (C3)  For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make a rule, in which the key is Hi,
         and the value is the Common prefix C followed by the Rule index
         Ri.  Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will have the
         length of (c + ri).

         Then we can do that:

               c = 40 => C = 2001:0db8:ff00::/40
               Rule 1: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff00::/41
               Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41

         As a result, for a certain CE delegating 2001:0db8:ff98:
         7650::/60, its parameters are:

Internet-Draft                     MAP                     November 2011


              Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41 => Rule 2
              IPv4 Suffix = bin(001 1000 0111 0110 0)
                                         PSID = bin(101) = 0x5
              Rule IPv4 Prefix = 63.245../16
              CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236

   If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition CEs into
   groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining the PSID length
   for them separately.

   Remarks:

   1.  The term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-
       assigned or recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going
       across the IPv6 domain backbone.  Therefore IPv6 address planning
       is independent of the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.

   2.  MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also applied
       for the case of legacy IPv4 networks keeping communication with
       the IPv4 world over the IPv6 domain without renumbering.  In such
       a case, unlike the residual deployment, the IPv6 addressing is
       not independent of IPv4.

   3.  For the non-residual deployment case, the address format, which
       is introduced by [RFC6052] as well as its extensions like
       [I-D.xli-behave-divi], is typically applied.  The relevance of
       MAP- and RFC6052-formats is: once a single rule applies for the
       whole IPv4 space, MAP-format becomes equivalent to RFC6052-
       format.  This frees the domain to distribute any specific rule
       information, including the DMR.

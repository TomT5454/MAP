    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes when and how an operator use the generic
      softwire's Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the IPv4 residual
      deployment in the IPv6-dominant domain.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address exhaustion has becoming world-wide reality and the main
      stream of deployment since now on is IPv6-only networking. Meanwhile,
      having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a long-term
      requirement, lasting until the completion of the IPv6 transition. It
      demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4 communications
      across the IPv6-only domain(s).</t>

      <t>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) <xref
      target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> is designed
      in response to the requirement of stateless residual deployment. The
      term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
      recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
      domain backbone. MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the prerequisite
      of deployment so that native IPv6 services and applications are fully
      supported and encouraged. The statelessness of MAP ensures only moderate
      overhead is added to part of the network devices.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators. This document
      is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP, i.e.,
      when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own operational
      requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility conditions, in the
      phase of IPv4 residual deployment. Potential readers of this document
      are those who want to know: <list style="numbers">
          <t>What kind of deployment requirements does MAP satisfy?</t>

          <t>What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
          and how?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
          IPv4 pools?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
          administrations?</t>

          <t>How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?</t>

    <section title="MAP Address Planning, a Step-by-step Guide">
      <t>This section is purposed to provide a referential guidance to
      operators, illustrating a common fashion of address planning with MAP in
      IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning. A simple
      example is taken inline for easy understanding.</t>

      <t>(A) IPv6 considerations</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(A1)">Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be
          supported, and, for generality, suppose N = 2^n.</t>

          <t hangText="">For example, we suppose n = 20. It means there will
          be up to about one million CEs.</t>

          <t hangText="(A2)">Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be
          assigned to ordinary customers.</t>

          <t hangText="">Considering we have a /32 IPv6 block, it is not a
          problem for the IPv6 deployment with the given number of CEs. Let x
          = 60, allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated networks.</t>

          <t hangText="(A3)">Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of
          two (K = 2 ^ k), to take into account that:</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Some privileged customers may be assigned IPv6
          prefixes of length x', shorter than x, to have larger addressing
          spaces than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and IPv4;</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many
          theoretically delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable
          (ref: host density ratio of <xref target="RFC3194"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="">In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>(B) IPv4 considerations</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(B1)">List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to
          any in-running networks) IPv4 prefixes Hi that are available for
          IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

          <t hangText="">Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet assigned
          to any fixed network: 192.32../16 and 63.245../16.</t>

          <t hangText="(B2)">Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to
          get a total whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes
          a good proportion of the available IPv4 space.</t>

          <!-- <t hangText="">
	  If the M < N, addresses should be shared by N CEs and thus
	each is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m) CEs with PSID length of 
	(n - m).
	  </t>.-->

          <t hangText="">If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore
          m = 17. Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the corresponding sharing
          ratio is also determined so that each CE can have 8192 ports to use
          under the shared global IPv4 address.</t>

          <t hangText="(B3)">For each IPv4 prefix Hi of length hi, choose a
          "rule index", i.e., the 4pfx in Fig.C-1 and Fig.C-3, say Ri of
          length ri = m - (32 - hi).</t>

          <t hangText="">All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes
          (e.g. 0, 10, 110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12).</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we have: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
H1 = 192.32../16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0); 
H2 = 63.245../16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1); 
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>(C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s)</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(C1)">Derive the length c of the "Common prefix" C that
          will appear at the beginning of all delegated prefixes (c = x - (n +
          k)).</t>

          <t hangText="(C2)">Take any prefix for this C of length c that
          starts with a RIR-allocated IPv6 prefix.</t>

          <t hangText="(C3)">For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make a rule, in which
          the key is Hi, and the value is the Common prefix C followed by the
          Rule index Ri. Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will have the
          length of (c + ri).</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we can do that: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
c = 40 => C = 2001:0db8:ff00::/40
Rule 1: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff00::/41
Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t hangText="">As a result, for a certain CE delegating
          2001:0db8:ff98:7650::/60, its parameters are: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41 => Rule 2
IPv4 Suffix = bin(001 1000 0111 0110 0) 
                           PSID = bin(101) = 0x5
Rule IPv4 Prefix = 63.245../16
CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition CEs into
      groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining the PSID length
      for them separately.</t>

      <t>Remarks:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent of
          the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.</t>

          <t>The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains IPv4
          addresses not yet assigned to customers/subscribers and/or those
          already recalled from ex-customers. Dynamic assignment is also
          considered of the case of "recalled".</t>

          <t>MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also applied
          for the case of legacy IPv4 networks keeping communication with the
          IPv4 world over the IPv6 domain without renumbering. In such a case,
          unlike the residual deployment, the IPv6 addressing is not
          independent of IPv4.</t>

          <t>For the non-residual deployment case, the address format, which
          is introduced by <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> as well as its
          extensions like <xref target="I-D.xli-behave-divi"></xref>, is
          typically applied. The relevance of MAP- and RFC6052-formats is:
          once a single rule applies for the whole IPv4 space, MAP-format
          becomes equivalent to RFC6052-format. This frees the domain to
          distribute any specific rule information, including the DMR.</t>

        <section title="Start from Scratch">
          <t>IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where
          parts of the network should properly updated gradually. As IPv6
          deployment progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a
          single-version network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in
          parallel would costs more than IPv6-only network. Therefore
          switching to an IPv6-only network in realtively small scale will
          become more prevalent. Meanwhile, a significant part of network will
          still stay in IPv4 for long time, especially at early stage of IPv6
          transition. There may not be enough public or private IPv4 addresses
          to support end-to-end network communication, without segmenting the
          network into small parts with sharing one IPv4 address space. That
          is a time to introduce MAP-based solution to bridge these IPv4
          islands through IPv6 network.</t>

          should have a big tolerance to allow different deployment modes to
          be occuring. Coexisting deployment would be a basic consideration
          for this casualness. In a potential practice, MAP-E and MAP-T would
          not only coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other
          deployment cases. Here lists some coexisting cases. (Note: more
          coexisting cases are expected to be investigated in future.)</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Case 1: Coexisting between MAP Encapsulation(MAP-E) and MAP
              Translation(MAP-T)</t>

              <t>Case 2: Coexisting between MAP translation(Double
              Translation) and NAT64 (Single Translation)</t>

              <t>Case3: Coexisting between MAP-based solution and native IPv6
              deployement</t>
            </list>Regarding the case 1, MAP<xref
          target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> has
          provided a good pre-condition, in which a unified address format and
          configuration rules have been documented to facilitate the
          collocation of MAP-T and MAP-E. Received date packages on CE or BR
          could be differentiated and processed accordingly through inspecting
          "Next Header" filed in IP header.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 2, separated gateway on the ISP network edge
          may serve MAP BR and NAT64 respectively. In alternative case, MAP BR
          or NAT64 functionality could be configured on the different
          interfaces on a standalone gateway. In either case, traffic could be
          distributed into proper gateway or interface by addressing diffrent
          IPv6 prefix as NAT4prefix and Rule IPv6 prefix.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 3, MAP solutions would not eliminate IPv6 host
          accessing MAP CE. Native IPv6 communication should get along with
          MAP solution. RFC6204<xref target="RFC6204"></xref> shoud be applied
          to CE in this case. Prefix delegation has two-fold, in which
          delegated prefix would not only help to create unique, longer IPv6
          prefixes for IPv6 hosts, but also serve MAP algorithm to implicitly
          derive shared IPv4 address/port information. When data packages have
          been received at CE, it would distinguish IPv4 packets from native
          IPv6 packets depending on preconfigured mapping rules.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Exit Strategy ">
          <t>The benefits of IPv6 + MAP-based solution are that all IPv6 flows
          would go directly to the Internet, no need further progressing on
          encapsulation or translation. In this way, as more content providers
          and service are available over IPv6, the utilization on MAP CE and
          BR goes down since fewer destinations require MAP progressing. This
          way would advance IPv6, because it provides everyone incentives to
          use IPv6, and eventually the result is an pure IPv6 network with no
          need for IPv4. As more content providers and hosts equiped with IPv6
          capabilities , the MAP utilization goes down until it is eventually
          not used at all when all content is IPv6. In this way, MAP has an
          "exit strategy". The corresponding solutions will leave the network
          in time.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Migration Mode">
        <t>IPv4 Residual deployment is a interim phase during IPv6 migration.
        It would be beneficial for ISPs, if this phase is as short as possible
        since end-to-end IPv6 traversal is the really goals. When IPv6 is
        getting more and more mature, MAP solution would be retired in a
        natural way or enforced by particular considerations.</t>

        <section title="Passive Transition">
          <t>Passive Transition is following IPv4 retirement law. In another
          word, MAP would always get along with IPv4 appearance, even all
          nodes is dual-stack capable. At a later stage of IPv6 migration, MAP
          based solutions can also be served for dual-stack hosts, which is
          sending traffic through the IPv4 stack. There is still a value for
          this approach because it could steer IPv4 traffic to IPv6 going
          through a MAP CE processing. When it comes the time when ISP decide
          to turn off IPv4, MAP would be faded due to IPv4 disappearance.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Active Transition">
          <t>Active Transition is targeting to acclerate IPv4 exit and
          increase native IPv6 utilization. A desirable way deploying MAP
          solution is only providing IPv6 traversal ability to a IPv4-only
          host. However, MAP CE can not determine received traffic is send
          from a IPv4 node or a dual-stack node. In the latter case, IPv6
          utilization is prefered in a common case. When a network evolve to a
          post-IPv6 era. It might be good for ISP to consider implement
          enforcements rules to help IPv6 migration. There is a set of
          approach would help the situation.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>ISP could install only IPv6 record (i.e. AAAA) in DNS server,
              which would provide users with IPv6 steering effects. When a
              host is IPv6-capable and gets IPv6 DNS reply in advance, MAP
              functionalities would be restricted by IPv6-only record
              reply</t>

              <t>ISP could retrieve shared IPv4 address by increasing sharing
              ratio. In this case, number of concurrent IPv4 sessions on MAP
              CE would be suppressed. It would encourage native IPv6 growth in
              some extent.</t>

              <t>ISP could allocate a dedicated IPv6 prefix for MAP
              deployment. The allocation could not only facilitate the
              differentiation between MAPed traffic and native IPv6 trafffic,
              but also clearly observe the tendency of MAP traffic. When the
              traffic is getting down for while, ISP could close the MAP
              functionalities in some specific area. It would result networks
              to native IPv6-only capable.</t>

    <section title="=== OLD TEXT === Deployment Considerations">
      <section title="Flexible Assigment of Port Sets">
        <t>Different classes of customers require port sets of different size.
        In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some customers would be
        satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses, while others may need to be
        assigned a single IPv4 address or delegated an IPv4 subnet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Traffic Classification">
        <t>Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure service
        quality for different classes of customers. This feature is also
        helpful for customer behavior monitoring and security protection. For
        example, DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) has been provided by
        operators for corporations to cater for their Internet communications
        needs. Service is made by means of the edge router features and key
        systems, like ACL (Access List Control) to classify different traffic.
        Five tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
        Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4. Vendors are delivering
        or committed to support that feature for IPv6. In order to
        facilitating IPv6 deployment, MAP solution should support this feature
        on IPv6 plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Prefix Delegation Deployment">
        <t>Prefix delegation is an important feature both for broadband and
        mobile network. In mobile network, prefix delegation is introduced in
        3GPP network in Release 10. The deployment of PD would be supported in
        4v6 case. Variable length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to CPE for
        deriving IPv4 information.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Coexisting Deployment">
        <t>4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not only
        coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other deployment
        cases. Here lists some coexisting cases. (Note: more coexisting cases
        are expected to be investigated in future.)</t>

        <t>o Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6
        translation</t>

        <t>o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64 (Single
        Translation)</t>

        <t>o Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Friendly to Network Provisioning">
        <t>Network management plane normally has an ability to to identify
        different users and the compatible with the address assignment
        techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to current practices on
        management plane. In 3GPP network, for example, only the IPv6 prefix
        is assigned to the devices, used to identify different users. And
        management plane for one family address is better than two, namely the
        operating platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6. Since
        only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is naturally
        conducted only via IPv6.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Enable privacy addresses">
        <t>User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution is
        deployed. Some security concern associated with non-changing IPv6
        interface identifiers has been expressed in RFC4941[RFC4941]. Ability
        to change the interface identifier over time makes it more difficult
        for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when
        different addresses used in different sessions actually correspond to
        the same node.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Facilitating 4v6 Service">
        <t>Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a shared
        address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server. The service provisioning may
        require well-know port range(i.e. port range belong to 0-1023). MAP
        would provide operators with possibilities to generate a port range
        including the 0-1023. Afterwards, operators could decide to assign it
        to any requesting user.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning">
        <t>The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by the
        encoded IPv4 or port ID information. MAP would prohibit IPv4 routing
        imported in IPv6.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Optimized Routing Path">
        <t>MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case and mesh
        case. Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow asymmetric routing,
        in which incoming routes would not be binded to a given border point
        but others geographically closed to traffic initiators. In mesh cases,
        traffic between CPEs could directly communicate without going through
        remote border point.</t>

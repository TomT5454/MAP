    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes when and how an operator use the 
	generic softwire's Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the 
	IPv4 residual deployment in the IPv6-dominant domain. </t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> IPv4 address exhaustion has becoming world-wide reality and
	the main stream of deployment since now on is IPv6-only
	networking. Meanwhile, having access to legacy IPv4 contents 
	and services is a long-term requirement, lasting until the 
	completion of the IPv6 transition. It demands sharing residual 
	IPv4 address pools for IPv4 communications across the 
	IPv6-only domain(s). </t>
 
      <t> Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) <xref target=
	"I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> is designed 
	in response to the requirement of stateless residual deployment. 
	The term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned 
	or recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across 
	the IPv6 domain backbone. MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as 
	the prerequisite of deployment so that native IPv6 services and 
	applications are fully supported and encouraged. The statelessness
	of MAP ensures only moderate overhead is added to part of the 
	network devices. </t>

      <t> Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators. This 
	document is motivated to provide basic understanding on the 
	usage of MAP, i.e., when and how an operator can do with MAP to
	meet its own operational requirements of IPv6 transition and its 
	facility conditions, in the phase of IPv4 residual deployment. 
	Potential readers of this document are those who want to know:
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t> What kind of deployment requirements does MAP satisfy?</t>
	  <t> What technical options needs to be considered when deploying
	      MAP, and how? </t> 
	  <t> How does MAP impact on the address planning for both 
	      IPv6 and IPv4 pools? </t>
	  <t> How does MAP impact on daily network operations and 
	      administrations? </t>
          <t> How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of 
	      MAP? </t> 
	</list>

    <section title="MAP Address Planning, a Step-by-step Guide">

	<t>This section is purposed to provide a referential guidance 
	to operators, illustrating a common fashion of address planning 
	with MAP in IPv4 residual deployment.  </t>

	<t> Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning. A 
	simple example is taken inline for easy understanding. </t>

	<t> (A) IPv6 considerations </t>

	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
	  <t hangText="(A1)">
	  Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be supported, 
	and, for generality, suppose N = 2^n.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText=""> For example, we suppose n = 20. It means 
	there will be up to about one million CEs. </t>
	  <t hangText="(A2)">
	  Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to 
        ordinary customers.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText=""> Considering we have a /32 IPv6 block, it
	is not a problem for the IPv6 deployment with the given number 
	of CEs. Let x = 60, allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated
	networks. </t>
	  <t hangText="(A3)">
	  Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of two 
        (K = 2 ^ k), to take into account that: </t>
	  <t hangText="   -"> Some privileged 
	customers may be assigned IPv6 prefixes of length x', shorter 
	than x, to have larger addressing spaces than ordinary customers,
	both in IPv6 and IPv4; </t>
	  <t hangText="   -"> Due to the hierarchy of routable 
	prefixes, many theoretically delegatable prefixes may not be 
	actually delegatable (ref: host density ratio of <xref 
	target="RFC3194" />).</t>
	  <t hangText="">In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity. </t>
	</list></t>

       <t> (B) IPv4 considerations </t>
	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
	  <t hangText="(B1)">
	  List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to any in-running 
	networks) IPv4 prefixes Hi that are available for IPv4 residual 
	deployment. 
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="">Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet 
	assigned to any fixed network: 192.32../16 and 63.245../16. </t>
	  <t hangText="(B2)">
	  Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to get a total 
	whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes 
	a good proportion of the available IPv4 space. 
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="">
	  If the M < N, addresses should be shared by N CEs and thus
	each is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m) CEs with PSID length of 
	(n - m).
	  </t>
	  <t hangText=""> If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and 
	therefore m = 17. Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the 
	corresponding sharing ratio is also determined so that each 
	CE can have 8192 ports to use under the shared global IPv4
	address. </t>
	  <t hangText="(B3)">
	  For each IPv4 prefix Hi of length hi, choose a "rule index", 
	i.e., the 4pfx in Fig.C-1 and Fig.C-3, say Ri of length 
	ri = m - (32 - hi). 
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="">
	  All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes (e.g. 0, 
	10, 110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12).
	  </t>
	  <t hangText=""> Then we have:
	  <figure><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
H1 = 192.32../16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0); 
H2 = 63.245../16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1); 
]]></artwork></figure></t>
	
	</list></t>

       <t> (C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s) </t>
	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
	  <t hangText="(C1)">
	  Derive the length c of the "Common prefix" C that will appear 
	at the beginning of all delegated prefixes (c = x - (n + k)).
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="(C2)">
	  Take any prefix for this C of length c that starts with a 
	RIR-allocated IPv6 prefix.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="(C3)">
	  For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make a rule, in which the key 
	is Hi, and the value is the Common prefix C followed by the 
	Rule index Ri. Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will
	have the length of (c + ri). 
	  </t>
	  <t hangText=""> Then we can do that:
	  <figure><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
c = 40 => C = 2001:0db8:ff00::/40
Rule 1: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff00::/41
Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41
]]></artwork></figure></t>
	  <t hangText=""> As a result, for a certain CE delegating 
2001:0db8:ff98:7650::/60, its parameters are:
	  <figure><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41 => Rule 2
IPv4 Suffix = bin(001 1000 0111 0110 0) 
                           PSID = bin(101) = 0x5
Rule IPv4 Prefix = 63.245../16
CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236
]]></artwork></figure></t>
	</list></t>

       <t>If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition 
       CEs into groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining 
       the PSID length for them separately. </t> 

	<t> Remarks: </t>
	<t><list style="numbers">
	  <t> IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent 
	     of the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses. </t>
	  <t> The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains  
	     IPv4 addresses not yet assigned to customers/subscribers 
	     and/or those already recalled from ex-customers. Dynamic
	     assignment is also considered of the case of "recalled".  
	  </t> 
	  <t> MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also
	     applied for the case of legacy IPv4 networks keeping 
	     communication with the IPv4 world over the IPv6 domain
	     without renumbering. In such a case, unlike the residual
	     deployment, the IPv6 addressing is not independent of 
	     IPv4.  
	  </t> 
	  <t> For the non-residual deployment case, the address format, 
	     which is introduced by <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> as 
	     well as its extensions like <xref 
	     target="I-D.xli-behave-divi"></xref>, is typically applied. 
	     The relevance of MAP- and RFC6052-formats is: once a 
	     single rule applies for the whole IPv4 space, MAP-format 
	     becomes equivalent to RFC6052-format. This frees the domain 
	     to distribute any specific rule information, including the 
	     DMR.

    <section title="=== OLD TEXT === Deployment Considerations">

      <section title="Flexible Assigment of Port Sets">

	<t>Different classes of customers require port sets of
	different size. In the context of shared IPv4 addresses, some
	customers would be satisfied with an shared IPv4 addresses,
	while others may need to be assigned a single IPv4 address or
	delegated an IPv4 subnet.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Traffic Classification">

	<t>Usually, ISPs adopt traffic classification to ensure
	service quality for different classes of customers. This
	feature is also helpful for customer behavior monitoring and
	security protection. For example, DIA (Dedicated Internet
	Access) has been provided by operators for corporations to
	cater for their Internet communications needs. Service is made
	by means of the edge router features and key systems, like ACL
	(Access List Control) to classify different traffic.  Five
	tuples would be identified from IP header and UDP/TCP header.
	Currently, it is very well supported in IPv4.  Vendors are
	delivering or committed to support that feature for IPv6.  In
	order to facilitating IPv6 deployment, MAP solution should
	support this feature on IPv6 plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Prefix Delegation Deployment">

	<t>Prefix delegation is an important feature both for
	broadband and mobile network.  In mobile network, prefix
	delegation is introduced in 3GPP network in Release 10.  The
	deployment of PD would be supported in 4v6 case.  Variable
	length of IPv6 prefix is assigned to CPE for deriving IPv4
	information.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Coexisting Deployment">

	<t>4v6 solutions(i.e. encapsulation and translation) would not
	only coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with
	other deployment cases.  Here lists some coexisting cases.
	(Note: more coexisting cases are expected to be investigated
	in future.)</t>

	<t>o  Case 1: Coexisting between 4v6 encapsulation and 4v6 translation</t>

	<t>o Case 2: Coexisting between 4v6 translation and NAT64
	(Single Translation)</t>

	<t>o  Case 3: Coexisting between 4v6 solutions and SLAAC</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Friendly to Network Provisioning">

	<t>Network management plane normally has an ability to to
	identify different users and the compatible with the address
	assignment techniques in the domain. 4v6 would conform to
	current practices on management plane.  In 3GPP network, for
	example, only the IPv6 prefix is assigned to the devices, used
	to identify different users.  And management plane for one
	family address is better than two, namely the operating
	platform does not need to manage both IPv4 and IPv6.  Since
	only IPv6 prefix is assigned, 4v6 on the management plane is
	naturally conducted only via IPv6.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Enable privacy addresses">

	<t>User privacy should be taken into account when 4v6 solution
	is deployed.  Some security concern associated with
	non-changing IPv6 interface identifiers has been expressed in
	RFC4941[RFC4941].  Ability to change the interface identifier
	over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other
	information collectors to identify when different addresses
	used in different sessions actually correspond to the same
	node.</t>

      <section title="Facilitating 4v6 Service">

	<t>Some ISPs may need to offer services in a 4v6 domain with a
	shared address, e.g. 4v6 node hosts FTP server.  The service
	provisioning may require well-know port range(i.e. port range
	belong to 0-1023).  MAP would provide operators with
	possibilities to generate a port range including the 0-1023.
	Afterwards, operators could decide to assign it to any
	requesting user.</t>

      <section title="Independency with IPv6 Routing Planning">

	<t>The IPv6 routing is easier to plan if it's not impacted by
	the encoded IPv4 or port ID information.  MAP would prohibit
	IPv4 routing imported in IPv6.</t>

      <section title="Optimized Routing Path">

	<t>MAP could achieve optimized routing path both for hub case
	and mesh case. Traffic in hub and spoke case could follow
	asymmetric routing, in which incoming routes would not be
	binded to a given border point but others geographically
	closed to traffic initiators. In mesh cases, traffic between
	CPEs could directly communicate without going through remote
	border point.</t>

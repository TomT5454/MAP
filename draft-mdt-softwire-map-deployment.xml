    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes when and how an operator uses the technique of 
	  Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the IPv4 residual
      deployment in the IPv6-dominant domain.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address exhaustion has become world-wide reality and the primary 
      solution in the industry is to deploy IPv6-only networking. Meanwhile,
      having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a long-term
      requirement, will be so until the completion of the IPv6 transition. It
      demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4 communications
      across the IPv6-only domain(s).</t>

      <t>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) <xref
      target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> is designed
      in response to the requirement of stateless residual deployment. The
      term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
      recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
      domain backbone. MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the prerequisite
      of deployment so that native IPv6 services and applications are fully
      supported and encouraged. The statelessness of MAP ensures only moderate
      overhead is added to part of the network devices.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators. This document
      is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP, i.e.,
      when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own operational
      requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility conditions, in the
      phase of IPv4 residual deployment. Potential readers of this document
      are those who want to know: <list style="numbers">
          <t>What are the requirements of MAP deployment ?</t>

          <t>What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
          and how?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
          IPv4 pools?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
          administrations?</t>

          <t>How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?</t>

      <t>MAP is suitable for deployment either in large-scale carrier (fixed)
      networks or in mobile networks. They have similar but different
      requirements.</t>

      <!-- SUBSECTION: FIXED NETWORKS, Qiong -->

      <section title="Fixed networks">
<t>There are typically two network models for fixed broadband access service: 
   one is to use PPPoE/PPPoA authentication method while the other is to use IPoE. 
   The first one is usually applied to Residential network and SOHO networks. 
   Subscribers in CPNs can access broadband network by PPP dial-up authentication. 
   BRAS is the key network element which takes full responsibility of IP address 
   assignment, user authentication, traffic aggregation, PPP session termination, 
   etc. Then IP traffic is forwarded to Core Routers through Metro Area Network, 
   and finally transited to Internet via Backbone network. The second network 
   scenario is usually applied to large enterprise networks. Subscribers in CPNs 
   can access broadband network by IPoE authentication. IP address is normally 
   assigned by DHCP server, or static configuration. </t>
<t>In either case, a CPE could obtain a prefix via prefix delegation procedure, 
   and the hosts behind CPE would get its own IPv6 addresses within the prefix 
   through SLAAC or DHCPv6 statefully. A MAP CE would also obtain a set of MAP 
   rules from DHCPv6 server. In MAP solution, both encapsulation and double 
   translation can be applied. </t>

   communication for fixed broadband access services. </t>

      <!-- SUBSECTION: MOBILE NETWORKS, Gang -->

      <section title="Mobile networks">
        <t>Regarding the MAP based solution, double translation is more
        suitable in mobile environment according to the analysis in stateless
        4V6<xref target="I-D.dec-stateless-4v6"></xref>. <xref target="MOBILE_NET" />
	depicts a typical model of MAP deployment in mobile network, where
        UE plays the rule of MAP CE. There may be three possible cases: IPv4 only, 
	IPv6 only or IPv6 and IPv4 connection to IP devices, depicted as H1, H2 
	and H3, respectively. The MAP CE may implement a internal NAT44 to provide 
	IPv4 connectin for multiple IP devices. The IP devices get /64 prefix from 
	MAP CE through RS/RA. Such a /64 prefix is generated from the prefix 
	assigned by the network through prefix delegation. In the process, 
	IPv6 prefix delegation is asked to derive the shared IPv4 address 
	implicitly. </t>

        <t>Prefix delegation is introduced in 3GPP network in Release 10. A
        MAP CE obtains IPv6 prefix from the mobile network. It then initiates
        DHCPv6 for prefix delegation. There are two phases for a MAP CE to
        perform prefix delegation function. In the first phase, the MAP CE
        attaches to the LTE network. The network provides the UE with IPv6
        only connection and the UE obtains a /64 IPv6 prefix. In the
        second phase, the MAP CE initiates prefix delegation procedure. The
        network assigns a prefix shorter than 64 to the MAP CE. 
	<xref target="MOBILE_NET" /> shows a case where a /56 is assigned to 
	MAP CE during prefix delegation. </t>

      <section title="Building the MAP domain">
      	
		<t>When deploying stateless MAP in operational network, a provider should firstly do MAP domain planning based on its own network condition. According to the definition of  <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref>, a MAP domain is a set of MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same virtual link. One MAP domain shares a common BR and has the same set of BMRs, FMRs and DMR, and it can be further divided into multiple sub-domains when multiple IPv4 subnets are deployed in one MAP domain. All CEs in the MAP domain are provisioned with the same set of MAP rules by MAP DHCPv6 server <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option"></xref>. There might be multiple BMRs in one MAP domain, and CE would pick up its own BMR by longest prefix matching lookup. However, all CEs within the sub-domain will have the same BMR. in which the BMR of all CEs is the same. In hub and spoke mode, CE would use DMR as its only FMR for outbound traffic; while in mesh mode, a longest-matching prefix lookup is done in the IPv4 routing table and the correct FMR is chosen.</t>
		<t>Basically, operator should firstly determine its own deployment mode for MAP domain: mesh or Hub and spoke, as different considerations for different deployment models should be applied accordingly. Afterwards, MAP domain planning, MAP rule provision, addressing and routing, etc., for a MAP domain should be taken into consideration.</t>
	<t>For the scenario where one CE is corresponding to multiple MAP border relays, 
	it is possible that those MAP BRs belong to different MAP domains. The CE must
	pick up its own MAP rules among these domains. It is a typical case of multihoming. 
	The MAP rules must have the information about BR(s) and the information about the 
	services types and the ISP.</t> 
		
		<section title="MAP deployment model planning">
		  <t>In order to do MAP domain planning, an operator should firstly make the decision to choose Mesh or Hub and Spoke model according to operator's network policy. In Hub and Spoke mode, all traffic within the same MAP domain has to go through BR which will result in less optimized traffic; however, it would simplify the CE process since there is no need to do FMR lookup for each incoming packet. Besides, it would have enhanced management ability as BR can take full control of all the traffic. As a result, it is reasonable to deploy Hub and Spoke mode for network with relatively flat architecture. </t>
		  <t>In mesh mode, traffic optimization can be achieved by CE to CE direct path. It is recommended to apply mesh mode in case CE to CE traffic is high and there are not too many MAP rules, say less than 10 MAP rules, in the specific domain.</t>
		</section>
		
        <section title="MAP domain planning">
		  <t>Stateless MAP has its own advantage in terms of scalability, high-reliability, etc. As a result, it is reasonable to apply a larger MAP domain to accommodate more subscribers with less BRs. Moreover, a larger MAP domain would also be easier for management and maintenance. However, a larger MAP domain may also result in less optimized traffic in Hub and spoke case, where all traffic has to go through a remote BR. Besides, it will also result in increased number of MAP rules and highly centralized address management, etc. It is a tradeoff to choose appropriate domain coverage.</t>
		  <t>Generally speaking, it is not recommended to use a large MAP domain in Hub and spoke model. While in mesh model, it is suggested to adopt a relatively larger MAP domain since traffic optimization has already been guaranteed, and the only concern is to make sure that the number of MAP rules is not too big.</t>
		  <t>Furthermore, MAP sub-domains can be divided for differentiated service provision. Different sub-domains could be distinguished by different Rule IPv4 prefixes. But all CEs within the same MAP sub-domain would have the same Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule IPv6 prefix and PSID parameters. </t>
        </section>
    
	<section title="MAP rule provisioning">
		<t> In stateless MAP, Mesh or Hub and Spoke communications can be achieved among CEs in one MAP domain in terms of assigning appropriate FMR(s) to CEs. We recommend ISP deploy the full Hub and Spoke mode or full mesh mode describe below, because the DHCPv6 server can simply achieve them.</t> 
		  <section title="Full Hub and Spoke Communication among CEs">
            <t>In order to achieve the full communication in the Hub and Spoke mode, no FMR is assigned to CEs. In this mode, when a CE sends packets to another CE in the same MAP domain using the DMR as FMR, the packets must go though BR before arriving at the destination.</t>
          </section>
          
          <section title="Full Mesh Communication among CEs">
            <t>Assigning all BMRs in MAP domain to each CE as FMRs, Mesh communications can be achieved among all CEs.  In this case, when CE receives an IPv4 packet, it looks up  for an appropriate FMR with a specific Rule IPv4 prefix which has the longest match with the IPv4 destination address.  If the FMR is found (destination is one of the CEs in the MAP domain), the packet will be forwarded to associated CE directly without going though BR. If the FMR is not found (destination is out of the MAP domain), the DMR will be selected as FMR, the CE then forwards the packet to the associated BR.</t>
          </section>
          
          <section title="Mesh or Hub/Spoke communication among some CEs">
            <t>Mesh communications among some CEs along with Hub/Spoke communications among some other CEs can be achieved by which differentiated FMRs are assigned to CEs. For instance, as <xref target="MESH-HUB-EXA"></xref> shown, Mapping rule 1, Mapping rule 2, Mapping rule 3 is provisioned to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively as BMR, and rule 1 and rule2, and rule 1 and rule 2 and rule 3, and rule 2 and rule 3 are assigned to CE1, CE2, CE3 respectively, then CE1 and CE2, CE2 and CE3 communicate directly without going though associated BR (Mesh mode), the communication between CE1 and CE3 must go though BR before reaching peer each other (Hub/Spoke mode).</t>

        <section title="MAP DHCPv6 server deployment consideration">
         <t>All the CEs within a MAP domain will get the same set of MAP rules by DHCPv6 server, including BMR, FMRs and DMR. In one MAP domain, BMR for different CEs might be different, but FMRs and DMR are all the same. Each Mapping Rule keeps a record of Rule IPv6 prefix, Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule EA-bits length and Rule Port Parameters. Section 5 would give a step by step example of how to calculate these parameters. </t>
	<t>In stateless MAP, the deployment of DHCPv6 server is independent with MAP domain planning. So there are three possible ways: </t>
	<t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:1">This is the ideal solution that each MAP domain would have its own MAP DHCPv6 server. In this case, MAP DHCPv6 server only needs to configure parameters for the specific MAP domain. It is highly recommended to adopt this deployment model in stateless MAP. </t>
	  <t hangText="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:N">This might happen when DHCPv6 servers are deployed in a large MAP domain in a distributed manner. In this case, all these DHCPv6 servers should be configured with the same set of MAP rules for the MAP domain, including mutiple BMRs, FMRs and DMRs.</t>
	  <t hangText="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = N:1">This might happen when MAP domain is relatively small and a single MAP DHCPv6 server is deployed in the network. In this case, multiple MAP domains should be distinguished based on CE's IPv6 prefix in different MAP domains. </t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t>Besides, the situation of remaining IPv4 address prefixes may have big impact on MAP rule planning, especially for service operators who only have rather scattered address space. Since the number of scattered IPv4 address prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR rules within a MAP domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address pool as possible to reduce the number of FMR rules.</t>	
        </section>
        
        <section title="PSID consideration">
          <t>For PSID provisioning, all the CEs, BR and DHCPv6 server within the same MAP domain should be configured with the same parameter value. All CEs with the same BMR should have the same PSID length. If a provider would like to introduce differentiated address sharing ratios for different CEs, it is better to define multiple MAP sub-domains with different Rule IPv4 prefixes. In this way, MAP domain division is only a logical method, rather than a geographical one.</t> 
		  <t> The default PSID offset is chosen as 4 in <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref>, which will exclude port range of 0-4096. Operator may adjust the value based on actual usage, policy, and service mode.</t>
		  <t>With regard to PSID format, both continuous and non-continuous port set can be supported in GMA algorithm. Non-continuous port set has the advantage of better security, UPnP friendly, etc., while continuous port set is the simplest way to implement. Since PSID format should be supported not only in CPEs, BRs and DHCPv6 server, but also in other sustaining systems as well, e.g. traffic logging system, user management system, a provider should make the decision based on a comprehensive investigation on its demand and the reality of existing equipments. </t>
		  <t>Note that some ISPs may need to offer services in a MAP domain with a shared address, e.g. there are hosts FTP server under CEs.  The service provisioning may require well-know port range (i.e. port range belong to 0-1023). MAP would provide operators with an option to generate a port range including those in 0-1023.  Afterwards, operators could decide to assign it to any requesting user.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Addressing and routing">
          <t> In MAP addressing, it should follow the MAP rule planning in the MAP domain. </t>
		  <t> For IPv4 addressing, since the number of scattered IPv4 address prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR rules within a MAP domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address pool as possible to reduce the number of FMR rules.For IPv6 address, the Rule IPv6 prefixes should be equal to the end user IPv6 prefix in MAP domain. </t>
		  <t>If ISP has a /24 rule IPv4 prefix with sharing ratio of 64 gives 16000 customers, and a /16 rule IPv4 prefix supports 4 million customer. If up the sharing ratio to 256, 64000 and 16 million customers can be supports respectively. For the ISP who have number of scattered IPv4 address prefixes, in order to reduce the FMRs, according to needs of ports they can divide different class. For instance, for the enterprise customers class which need many ports to use, provision them the BMR with low sharing ratio while for the private customers class which don't need so many ports provision them the BMR with high sharing ratio.</t>
		  <t>For MAP routing, there are no IPv4 routes exported to IPv6 networks. </t>
        </section>
        

        <section title="Translation vs. Encapsulation">
	Basically, encapsulation provides an architectural building block of 
  virtual link where the underlay behavior is fully hidden, while translation 
  does a delivery participating into the end-to-end transferring path where 
  behaviors are exposed. It is reflected in the following aspects. 
  
  <t>1. Option header</t>
  <t>There may be some options in the IPv4 header, and some of them may
  not be able to mapped to IPv6 option headers accurately [RFC791][RFC2460].
  If Translation is used, those options can not be supported, and
  packets with those options SHOULD be dropped. Encapsulation does
  not have this problem. </t>

  <t>2. ICMP</t>
  <t>Some IPv4 ICMP codes do not have a corresponding codes in ICMPv6, a 
  detailed analysis on the double translation behavior suggest that some 
  ICMPv4 messages, when they are translated to ICMPv6 and back to ICMPv4 
  across the IPv6 domain, the accuracy might be sacrificed to some extent.  
  Encapsulation keeps the full transparency of ICMPv4 messages, while translation
  can make in-transition access through either single or double translations 
  with a unified solution. </t>

  <t>In either the encapsulation or translation mode, if an intermediate node 
  generates an ICMPv6 error message, it should be converted into ICMPv4 version 
  and returned to the source with a special source address set to 192.70.192.254
  [I-D.xli-behave-icmp-address], in the stateless MAP architecture.</t>

  <t>3. PMTU and fragmentation</t>
  <t>Both translation mode and encapsulation mode have PMTU and fragmentation
  problem. <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> discusses the problem in details for the 
  translation, while <xref target="RFC2473"></xref> could be a good reference on the 
  issue in encapsulation. </t>

  <!-- t>4. End-user IPv6 prefix restrictions</t>
  <t>Translation mode doen't permit the End-user IPv6 prefix to exceed 64bits 
  while encapsulation mode doesn't have that restrictions. If ISP only has long 
  IPv6 prefixes used as Rule IPv6 prefix, the end-user IPv6 prefix is possible 
  to exceed 64bits, in this case, the translation mode may not be suitable.</t

      <section title="BR settings">
        <t>1. BR placement</t>

		<t>BR placement has important impacts on the operation of a MAP domain.</t>

        <t>A first concern should be the avoidance of "triangle routing". That is, the path from the CE to an IPv4 peer via the BR should be close to the one that would be taken if the CE had native IPv4 connectivity. This can be accomplished easily by placing the BR close to the CE, such that the length of the path from the CE to the BR is minimized.</t>

        <t>However, minimizing the CE-BR path would ignore a second concern, that of minimizing IPv4 operations. An ISP deploying MAP will probably want to focus on IPv6 operations, while keeping IPv4 operational expenditures to a minimum. This would imply that the size of the IPv4 network that the ISP has to administer would be kept to a minimum. Placing the BR near the CE means that the length of the IPv4 network between the BR and the IPv4 Internet would be longer.</t>
        
		<t>Moreover, in case where the set of CEs is geographically dispersed, multiple BRs would be needed, which would further enlarge the IPv4 network that the ISP has to maintain.</t>

        <t>Therefore, we offer the following guideline: BRs should be placed as close to the border with the IPv4 Internet as possible while keeping triangle routing to a minimum. Regional POPs should probably be considered as potential candidates.</t>

        <t>Note also that MAP being stateless, asymmetric routing is possible, meaning that separate BRs can be used for traffic entering and exiting a MAP domain.  This option can be considered for its effects on traffic engineering.</t>

        <t>Anycast can be used to let the network pick BR closest to a CE for traffic exiting the MAP domain. This is accomplished by provisioning a Default Mapping Rule containing an anycast IPv6 address or prefix. Operationally, this allows incremental deployment of BRs in strategic locations without modifying the provisioning system's configuration. CE's close to a newly-deployed BR will automatically start using it.</t>


        <t>2. Reliability Considerations</t>

		
        <t>Reliability of MAP is derived in major part from its statelessness. This means that MAP can benefit from the usual methods of Internet reliability.</t>

        <t>Anycast, already mentioned in section 4.2.1, can be used to ensure reliability of traffic from CE to BR. Since there can be only one Default Mapping Rule per MAP domain, traffic from CE to BR will always use the same destination address (in encapsulation mode) or prefix (in translation mode).  When this address or prefix is anycast, reliability is greatly increased. If a BR goes down, it stops advertising the IPv6 anycast address or prefix, and traffic is automatically re-routed to other BRs. For this mechanism to work correctly, it is crucial that the anycast route announcement be very closely tied to BR availability. See [RFC4786] for best current practices on the operation of anycast services. </t>

        <t>Anycast covers global reliability. Reliability within a single link can be achieved with the help of a redundancy protocol such as VRRP [RFC5798]. This allows operation of a pair of BRs in active/standby configuration. No state needs to be shared for the operation of MAP, so there is no need to keep the standby node in a "warm" state: as long as it is up and ready to take over the virtual IPv6 address, quick failover can be achieved. This makes the pair behave as a single, much more reliable node, with less reliance on quick routing protocol convergence for reliability.</t>

        <t>It is expected that production-quality MAP deployments will make use of both anycast and a redundancy protocol such as VRRP.</t>

        <t>3. MTU/Fragmentation</t>

        <t>If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the MAP domain, then the 4rd Tunnel MTU can be set to the known IPv6 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv4 header (40 bytes).  For example, if the IPv6 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 4rd Tunnel MTU might be set to 1460 bytes.  Without more specific information, the 4rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.</t>

        <t>When using encapsulation mode, it is important that fragments of a MAP packet sent according to the Default Mapping Rule be handled by the same BR.  (This is not required for translation mode.) This can be a problem when using an anycast BR address and routing fluctuations cause fragments of a packet to be routed to multiple BRs.</t>

        <t>BRs using an anycast address as source can cause problems. If traffic sent by a BR with a source anycast address causes an ICMP error to be returned, that error packet's destination address will be an anycast address, meaning that a different BR might receive it. In the case of a Too Big ICMP error, this could cause a path MTU discovery black hole. Another possible problem could occur if fragmented packets from different BRs using the same anycast address as source happen to contain the same fragment ID. This would break fragment reassembly.</t>
        <t>Therefore, when using anycast addresses, it is RECOMMENDED that they be only used as destination address, and never as source addresses. BRs SHOULD be configured to accept traffic sent to the anycast address, but use an unicast address as source.</t>

        <t>In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are not shared, IPv6 destinations are derived from IPv4 addresses alone.  Thus, each IPv4 packet can be encapsulated and decapsulated independently of each other. 4rd processing is completely stateless.</t>

        <t>On the other hand, in MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are shared, BRs and CEs may have to encapsulate or translate IPv4 packets whose IPv6 destinations depend on destination ports.  Precautions are needed, due to the fact that the destination port of a fragmented datagram is available only in its first fragment.  A sufficient precaution consists in reassembling each datagram received in multiple packets, and to treat it as though it would have been received in single packet.  This function is such that MAP is in this case stateful at the IP layer.  (This is common with DS-lite and NAT64/DNS64 which, in addition, are stateful at the transport layer.)  At domain entrance, this ensures that all pieces of all received IPv4 datagrams go to the right IPv6 destinations.</t>

        <t>Another peculiarity of shared IPv4 addresses is that, without precaution, a destination could simultaneously receive from different sources fragmented datagrams that have the same Datagram ID (the Identification field of [RFC0791]).  This would disturb the reassembly process.  To eliminate this risk, CE MUST rewrite the datagram ID to a unique value among CEs sharing an IPv4 address upon sending the packet over a MAP domain.  This value SHOULD be generated locally within the port-range assigned to a given CE.  Note that replacing a Datagram ID in an IPv4 header implies an update of its Header-checksum field, by adding to it the one's complement difference between the old and the new values.</t>
        <t></t>
      </section>

      <section title="CE settings">

        <t>1. bridging vs. routing mode</t>

        <t>In routing mode, the CE runs a standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using the allocated public
   address as external IP and ports via DHCPv6 option.  When receiving an IPv4 packet with
   private source address from its end hosts, it performs NAT44 function
   by translating the source address into public and selecting a port
   from the allocated port-set.  Then it encapsulates/translates the packet with
   the concentrator's IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address, and
   forwards it to the concentrator.  When receiving an IPv6
   packet from the concentrator, the initiator decapsulates/translates the IPv6
   packet to get the IPv4 packet with public destination IPv4 address.
   Then it performs NAT44 function and translates the destination
   address into private one. </t>

        <t>The CE is responsible for performing ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP),
   as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP,
   manual mapping configuration).  This is no different from the
   standard IPv4 NAT today.</t>

       <t>For the bridging mode, end host would run a software performing CE functionalities. In this case, end host gets public address directly.
   It is also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly
   generated ports into the restricted, valid port-set.  Another
   solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the
   restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every source port number in the outgoing packets
   falls into the allocated port-set.
</t>

        <t>2. CE-initiated application</t>

        <t>CE-initiated case is applied for situations where applications run on CE directly. If the application in CE use the public address directly, it might conflict with other CEs. So it is highly suggested that CE should also run a local NAT to map a private address to public address in CE. In this way, the CE IPv4 address passed to local applications would be conflict with other CEs. Moreover, CE should guarantee that every source port number in the outgoing packets falls into the allocated port-set.</t>

      <section title="Supporting system">
        <t>1. Lawful Intercept</t>
<t>Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to
lawful intercept. For details, see [RFC6269] section 12.</t>
        

        <t>2. Traffic Logging</t>
<t>It is always possible for a service provider that operates a MAP domain to determine the IPv6 prefix associated with a MAP IPv4 address (and port number in case of a shared address). This mapping is static, and it is therefore unnecessary to log every IPv4 address assignment. However, changes in that static mapping, such as rule changes in the provisioning system, need to be logged in order to be able to know the mapping at any point in time.</t>

<t>Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to traffic logging. For details, see [RFC6269] sections 8 and 13.1.</t>

    <section title="MAP Address Planning, a Step-by-step Guide">
      <t>This section is purposed to provide a referential guidance to
      operators, illustrating a common fashion of address planning with MAP in
      IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning. </t>

      <t>(A) IPv6 considerations</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(A1)">Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be
          supported, and, for generality, suppose N = 2^n.</t>

          <t hangText="">For example, we suppose n = 20. It means there will
          be up to about one million CEs.</t>

          <t hangText="(A2)">Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be
          assigned to ordinary customers.</t>

          <t hangText="">Consider we have a /32 IPv6 block, it is not a
          problem for the IPv6 deployment with the given number of CEs. Let x
          = 60, allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated networks.</t>

          <t hangText="(A3)">Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of
          two (K = 2 ^ k), to take into account that:</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Some privileged customers may be assigned IPv6
          prefixes of length x', shorter than x, to have larger addressing
          spaces than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and IPv4;</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many
          theoretically delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable
          (ref: host density ratio of <xref target="RFC3194"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="">In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>(B) IPv4 considerations</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(B1)">List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to
          any in-running networks) IPv4 prefixes {Hi} that are available for
          IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

          <t hangText="">Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet assigned
          to any fixed network: 192.32.0.0/16 and 63.245.0.0/16. </t>

          <t hangText="(B2)">Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to
          get a total whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes
          a good proportion of the available IPv4 space.</t>

          <!-- <t hangText="">
	  If the M < N, addresses should be shared by N CEs and thus
	each is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m) CEs with PSID length of 
	(n - m). Once the PSID length is determined, the EA-bit length is 
	determined too, as equals to the sum of PSID length and the IPv4 
	suffix length. 
	  </t>.-->

          <t hangText="">If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore
          m = 17. Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the corresponding sharing
          ratio is also determined so that each CE can have 8192 ports to use
          under the shared global IPv4 address; and accordingly the EA-bit 
	  length is (32 - 16) + 3 = 19 bits.</t>

          <t hangText="(B3)">For each IPv4 prefix, Hi, of length hi, choose 
          an index, say Ri of length ri = m - (32 - hi).</t>

          <t hangText="">All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes
          (e.g. 0, 10, 110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12). In our 
	  example, we pick 0 for a contiguous block while 1 for another.</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we have: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
H1 = 192.32.0.0./16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0); 
H2 = 63.245.0.0./16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1); 
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Sometimes the IPv4 residual pool is not well aggregated and the 
	 contiguous blocks may have different sizes. For example, in (B1), 
	 if we have H1 = 59.112.0.0/13 and H2 = 219.120.0.0/16 as the IPv4 
	 residual pool, then M = 2^19 + 2^16, and in such a case, we must 
	 pick m so that m = ceil(log2(M)), where "ceil(x)" means the 
  	 minimum integer not less than x, i.e., m = 20 in this case. 
	 Therefore r1 = 20 - (32 - 13) = 1, while r2 = 20 - (32 - 16) = 4. 
	 Several combinations are available for the R1 and R2 and one only 
	 needs to pay attention to avoiding overlapping when picking up 
	 the values. 
      </t>

      <t>(C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s)</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(C1)">Derive the length c of the MAP domain IPv6 prefix,
	  C, that will appear at the beginning of all delegated prefixes 
	  (c = x - (n + k)).</t>

          <t hangText="(C2)">Take any prefix for this C of length c that
          starts with a RIR-allocated IPv6 prefix.</t>

          <t hangText="(C3)">For each IPv4 prefix Hi, make the rule, in which
          the key is Hi and the value is the domain IPv6 prefix C followed by 
	  the rule index Ri. Then this i-th rule's Rule IPv6 Prefix will have the
          length of (c + ri).</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we can do that: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
c = 40 => C = 2001:0db8:ff00::/40
Rule 1: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff00::/41
Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41
]]></artwork>
            </figure>
	  If we have different lengths for the Rule IPv4 prefix (as the extra 
	  example discussed at the end of (B)), their Rule IPv6 prefixes should 
	  not have the same length, as their rule index length is different. 
	  </t>

          <t hangText="">As a result, for a certain CE delegating
          2001:0db8:ff98:7650::/60, its parameters are: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41 => Rule 2
IPv4 Suffix = bin(001 1000 0111 0110 0) 
                           PSID = bin(101) = 0x5
Rule IPv4 Prefix = 63.245.0.0/16
CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition CEs into
      groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining the PSID length
      for them separately.</t>

      <t>Remarks:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent of
          the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.</t>

          <t>The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains IPv4
          addresses not yet assigned to customers/subscribers and/or those
          already recalled from ex-customers. Dynamic assignment is also
          considered of the case of "recalled".</t>

          <t>MAP is mainly designed for residual deployment but also applied
          for the case of legacy IPv4 networks keeping communication with the
          IPv4 world over the IPv6 domain without renumbering. In such a case,
          unlike the residual deployment, the IPv6 addressing is not
          independent of IPv4.</t>

          <t>For the non-residual deployment case, the address format, which
          is introduced by <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> as well as its
          extensions like <xref target="I-D.xli-behave-divi"></xref>, is
          typically applied. The relevance of MAP- and RFC6052-formats is:
          once a single rule applies for the whole IPv4 space, MAP-format
          becomes equivalent to RFC6052-format. This frees the domain to
          distribute any specific rule information, including the DMR.</t>

    <section title="Migration Methodology">
      <section title="Roadmap for MAP-based Solution">
        <t></t>

        <section title="Start from Scratch">
          <t>IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where
          parts of the network should properly updated gradually. As IPv6
          deployment progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a
          single-version network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in
          parallel would costs more than IPv6-only network. Therefore
          switching to an IPv6-only network in relatively small scale will
          become more prevalent. Meanwhile, a significant part of network will
          still stay in IPv4 for a long time, especially at early stage of IPv6
          transition. There may not be enough public or private IPv4 addresses
          to support end-to-end network communication, without segmenting the
          network into small parts with sharing one IPv4 address space. That
          is a time to introduce MAP-based solution to bridge these IPv4
          islands through IPv6 backbone network.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Coexiting Phases">
          <t>A operator may has various deployment strategies. The deployment of
          MAP-based solution(i.e., MAP-encapsulation and MAP-translation)
          should have a big tolerance to allow different deployment modes to
          be occuring. Coexisting deployment would be a basic consideration
          for this casualness. In a potential practice, MAP-E and MAP-T would
          not only coexist with each other, but also can harmonize with other
          deployment cases. Here lists some coexisting cases. (Note: more
          coexisting cases are expected to be investigated in future.)</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Case 1: Coexisting between MAP Encapsulation(MAP-E) and MAP
              Translation(MAP-T)</t>

              <t>Case 2: Coexisting between MAP translation(Double
              Translation) and statelss NAT64 (Single Translation)</t>

              <t>Case3: Coexisting between MAP-based solution and native IPv6
              deployement</t>
            </list>Regarding the case 1, MAP<xref
          target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref> has
          provided a good pre-condition, in which a unified address format and
          configuration rules have been documented to facilitate the
          collocation of MAP-T and MAP-E. Received data packets on CE or BR
          could be differentiated and processed accordingly through inspecting
          "Next Header" filed in IP header.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 2, separated gateway on the ISP network edge
          may serve MAP BR and NAT64 respectively. In alternative case, MAP BR
          or NAT64 functionality could be configured on the different
          interfaces on a standalone gateway. In either case, traffic could be
          distributed into proper gateway or interface by addressing diffrent
          IPv6 prefix as NAT4prefix and Rule IPv6 prefix.</t>

          <t>Regarding the case 3, MAP solutions would not eliminate IPv6 host
          accessing MAP CE. Native IPv6 communication should get along with
          MAP solution. RFC6204  shoud be applied
          to CE in this case. Prefix delegation has two-fold, in which
          delegated prefix would not only help to create unique, longer IPv6
          prefixes for IPv6 hosts, but also serve MAP algorithm to implicitly
          derive shared IPv4 address/port information. When data packages have
          been received at CE, it would distinguish IPv4 packets from native
          IPv6 packets depending on preconfigured mapping rules.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Exit Strategy ">
          <t>The benefits of IPv6 + MAP-based solution are that all IPv6 flows
          would go directly to the Internet, no need further progressing on
          encapsulation or translation. In this way, as more content providers
          and service are available over IPv6, the utilization on MAP CE and
          BR goes down since fewer destinations require MAP progressing. This
          way would advance IPv6, because it provides everyone incentives to
          use IPv6, and eventually the result is an pure IPv6 network with no
          need for IPv4. As more content providers and hosts equiped with IPv6
          capabilities , the MAP utilization goes down until it is eventually
          not used at all when all content is IPv6. In this way, MAP has an
          "exit strategy". The corresponding solutions will leave the network
          in time.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Migration Mode">
        <t>IPv4 Residual deployment is an interim phase during IPv6 migration.
        It would be beneficial for ISPs, if this phase is as short as possible
        since end-to-end IPv6 traversal is the really goals. When IPv6 is
        getting more and more mature, MAP solution would be retired in a
        natural way or enforced by particular considerations.</t>

        <section title="Passive Transition">
          <t>Passive Transition is following IPv4 retirement law. In another
          word, MAP would always get along with IPv4 appearance, even all
          nodes is dual-stack capable. At a later stage of IPv6 migration, MAP
          based solutions can also be served for dual-stack hosts, which is
          sending traffic through the IPv4 stack. There is still a value for
          this approach because it could steer IPv4 traffic to IPv6 going
          through a MAP CE processing. When it comes the time when ISP decide
          to turn off IPv4, MAP would be faded due to IPv4 disappearance.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Active Transition">
          <t>Active Transition is targeting to accelerate IPv4 exit and
          increase native IPv6 utilization. A desirable way deploying MAP
          solution is only providing IPv6 traversal ability to an IPv4-only
          host. However, MAP CE can not determine received traffic is sent
          from an IPv4 node or a dual-stack node. In the latter case, IPv6
          utilization is prefered in a common case. When a network evolves to a
          post-IPv6 era, it might be good for ISP to consider implementing
          enforcements rules to help IPv6 migration. There is a set of
          approach would help the situation.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>ISP could install only IPv6 record (i.e. AAAA) in DNS server,
              which would provide users with IPv6 steering effects. When a
              host is IPv6-capable and gets IPv6 DNS reply in advance, MAP
              functionalities would be restricted by IPv6-only record
              reply</t>

              <t>ISP could retrieve shared IPv4 address by increasing sharing
              ratio. In this case, number of concurrent IPv4 sessions on MAP
              CE would be suppressed. It would encourage native IPv6 growth in
              some extent.</t>

              <t>ISP could allocate a dedicated IPv6 prefix for MAP
              deployment. The allocation could not only facilitate the
              differentiation between MAPed traffic and native IPv6 trafffic,
              but also clearly observe the tendency of MAP traffic. When the
              traffic is getting down for while, ISP could close the MAP
              functionalities in some specific area. It would result networks
              to native IPv6-only capable.</t>
